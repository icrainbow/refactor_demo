SOURCE OF FUNDS DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS:

CLIENT DISCLOSURE (Current):
${disclosureCurrent}

WEALTH DIVISION RECORD (Q4 2024):
${disclosureWealth}

DISCREPANCY MAGNITUDE:
The reported AUM is 10x higher than the client's stated source of funds. This significant mismatch requires explanation and verification of:
- Origin of the additional $45M
- Whether these are separate accounts or consolidated holdings
- Timing of wealth accumulation vs. disclosure date
- Potential undisclosed business interests or inheritance

RECOMMENDATION:
Request detailed breakdown of all funding sources and cross-reference with historical account statements and tax filings.`

REGULATORY POLICY UPDATE:

COMPLIANCE IMPACT:
This policy change mandates Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for all offshore holding structures with more than 2 layers. 
The client's structure meets this threshold and must undergo additional review including:
- UBO verification through independent sources
- Source of funds for each layer of the structure
- Economic substance verification in each jurisdiction
- Tax compliance documentation from all relevant jurisdictions

ACTION REQUIRED:
Initiate EDD procedures immediately. Do not proceed with onboarding until EDD review is completed and approved.`
