  assistant_text: `Based on the integration guidelines and legacy CS risk policies, I've identified a specialized exception approval path for this scenario.

**Key Findings:**
The CS Integration Strategy (2025) explicitly allows for retention of strategically valuable HNW clients who fall outside current UBS risk appetite, provided specific controls are met. However, the restricted jurisdiction classification triggers mandatory escalation.

**Recommended Path:**
1) First, remediate data gaps by retrieving the client's original CS onboarding files and enhanced due diligence reports from the CS archive system (Confluence Page ID: 8821).

2) The Relationship Manager must complete a Strategic Value Waiver (template WM-2025-03) with business justification and secure pre-approval from the Regional Group Head.

3) Because this case involves a conflict between UBS and legacy CS risk appetites, the Policy Memo on Risk Alignment Post-Merger requires routing through the Joint Steering Committee for case-by-case review.

4) Final approval authority rests with the Group Head for Wealth Management due to the "Restricted Jurisdiction" designation.

This path ensures compliance while preserving strategic client relationships during the integration period.`,
