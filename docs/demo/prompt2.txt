Project Goal

Build a demo-only web application to showcase a chat-first, multi-agent document evaluation experience.

This is NOT a production system.
The goal is to visually and interaction-wise demonstrate:

Chat as the primary entry point

Document sectioning

Per-section Evaluate / Modify actions

Visible multi-agent collaboration (via UI text, not real agents)

Accuracy of logic is NOT required.
UI clarity and narrative coherence are the priority.

🔒 Scope Constraints (IMPORTANT)

❌ No backend logic required

❌ No real file parsing

❌ No real LLM / agent orchestration

❌ No authentication

❌ No persistence

Everything can be mocked, hardcoded, or state-driven.

🧱 Tech Stack Constraints

Use Next.js (App Router) + React

Use client-side state only

Styling: simple CSS / Tailwind (choose one, minimal styling)

Do NOT introduce new heavy dependencies

🖼️ Figma Reference Requirement (Critical)

This implementation is based on a Figma demo prototype.

Therefore:

Structure the UI to closely match a Figma-style demo, meaning:

Clear panels

Card-based sections

Obvious color states (grey / green / red)

Chat panel always visible

You do NOT need pixel-perfect Figma matching,
but the layout must clearly reflect a demo storyboard, not a generic app.

🧩 Pages to Implement
Page 1: Chat Entry Page (/)

Purpose:
Demonstrate chat as the system entry point.

Layout

Centered chat window

Initial system greeting message (hardcoded):

Hi, I’m your AI Investment Assistant.
To get started, tell me about your investment goals,
or upload a document to evaluate.


Below the chat input, two buttons:

Upload

Evaluate

Behavior

Clicking Upload → navigate to /document

Clicking Evaluate → no logic needed (can show a placeholder message)

Page 2: Document Section Page (/document)

This is the core demo page.

Layout Structure

Split screen:

Left / Main Area: Document Sections

Right or Bottom Panel: Chat + Agent Messages

📄 Document Sections (Hardcoded)

Create 3 hardcoded sections, e.g.:

Section 1: “Investment Background”

Section 2: “Risk Assessment”

Section 3: “Technical Strategy”

Each section is rendered as a card containing:

Section title

Short placeholder text

Two buttons:

Modify

Evaluate

Initial section state:

Status: unevaluated

Color: neutral / grey

✅ Per-Section Evaluate Logic (Mocked)

When Evaluate is clicked on a section:

Change section state to:

pass → green border/background

or fail → red border/background

The result can be:

Hardcoded

Or alternating (for demo clarity)

At the same time, append a message in the chat panel like:

[Evaluate Agent]:
Section 2 does not meet evaluation criteria.

🧠 Modify Logic (Mocked)

When Modify is clicked:

Do NOT change content automatically

Append a chat message such as:

[Optimize Agent]:
Ready to optimize Section 3 based on user input.


No real editing required.

📊 Global Evaluate & Submit (Bottom Actions)

At the bottom of the sections list:

Button: Global Evaluate

When clicked:

If all sections are green → show green “OK”

If any section is red → show red “NOK”

This is purely based on UI state

Also append chat message:

[Evaluate Agent]:
Overall document evaluation completed: NOK.

Button: Submit

Clicking Submit:

Show a simple confirmation state

Example text: “Document submitted successfully.”

No backend call required

💬 Chat & Agent Interaction Panel

This panel exists to visually demonstrate multi-agent collaboration.

Requirements

Chat input box (user can type anything)

On user message, append mock agent responses

Example User Input

“I think Section 2 can be shortened to 100 words.”

Mock Response (Hardcoded or rule-based)
[Optimize Agent]:
Optimizing Section 2.
User request: shorten to 100 words.

Important

Agent identity MUST be explicitly visible:

[Optimize Agent]

[Evaluate Agent]

This is critical to demonstrate multi-agent vs single-agent

🎨 Visual State Rules (Very Important)

Use clear visual cues:

Grey = Not evaluated

Green = Pass

Red = Fail

Agent messages should be visually distinct from user messages.

🚫 Explicit Non-Goals

Do NOT:

Implement real document parsing

Implement real LLM calls

Implement real agent frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)

Over-engineer state management

This is a demo storytelling UI, not a system build.

✅ Final Deliverable Expectation

At the end, the app should:

Be runnable locally

Allow clicking through the full demo flow

Clearly demonstrate:

Chat-first interaction

Section-based document handling

Visible multi-agent collaboration

Evaluate vs Optimize separation

🧭 Developer Guidance

If any logic is ambiguous:

Choose the simplest possible implementation

Prefer hardcoded demo clarity over correctness

Ask for clarification only if absolutely blocking
