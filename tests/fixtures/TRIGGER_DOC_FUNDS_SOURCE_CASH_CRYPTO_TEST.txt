ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE - SOURCE OF FUNDS INVESTIGATION

Client Name: Viktor Chen
Account Type: Private Banking / High Net Worth
Requested Services: Multi-currency accounts, cryptocurrency custody, offshore transfers

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOURCE OF FUNDS - CASH-INTENSIVE BUSINESS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ALERT: Declared source of funds raises CRITICAL money laundering concerns

Client's Business Declaration:
- Primary Business: Cash-intensive retail operations (convenience stores, money exchange)
- Geographic Scope: 47 locations across Southeast Asia
- Annual Revenue (Declared): $23M USD (85% cash transactions)
- Secondary Income: Cryptocurrency trading and "digital asset consulting"

Cash Handling Red Flags:
✗ LARGE CASH deposits averaging $180K weekly across multiple bank accounts
✗ Cash business model in jurisdictions with weak AML controls (Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos)
✗ No adequate explanation for cash-to-crypto conversion patterns
✗ Deposits often just below reporting thresholds ($9,800 - $9,950 USD)
✗ Structuring behavior: Multiple same-day deposits across different branches

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRYPTOCURRENCY & MIXING SERVICES - HIGH RISK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CRITICAL ALERT: Blockchain analysis reveals use of PROHIBITED services

Cryptocurrency Transaction Analysis:
- Wallet addresses linked to client: 14 identified across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero
- Total crypto holdings (estimated): $8.4M USD equivalent
- Mixing services detected: TornadoCash (Ethereum mixer - sanctioned by OFAC)
- Tumbler usage: ChipMixer (Bitcoin tumbler - shut down by law enforcement 2023)
- DEX (Decentralized Exchange) activity: $2.1M traded on non-KYC platforms

Blockchain Forensics Findings:
✗ 67% of incoming crypto funds passed through MIXING SERVICES before client wallets
✗ Privacy coins (Monero): $1.2M in transactions (untraceable by design)
✗ Peer-to-peer exchanges with NO KYC: Frequent use of LocalBitcoins, Bisq
✗ Wallet clustering suggests deliberate obfuscation of transaction trails
✗ Some incoming funds traced to darknet marketplace wallets (archived data)

SANCTIONS CONCERN: TornadoCash sanctioned by US Treasury (August 2022).
Any interaction with sanctioned entity requires SAR filing and transaction blocking.

RISK ASSESSMENT - SOURCE OF FUNDS CONCLUSION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERALL RISK RATING: CRITICAL / UNACCEPTABLE FOR ONBOARDING

Source of Funds Risk Summary:
✗ Cash-intensive business in weak AML jurisdictions (placement layer)
✗ LARGE CASH deposits with structuring patterns (regulatory violation)
✗ Cryptocurrency mixer and tumbler usage (OFAC sanctioned services)
✗ Privacy coin transactions (Monero - untraceable)
✗ Tax evasion indicators (37x income/wealth discrepancy)
✗ No adequate explanation for wealth accumulation

LEGAL & REGULATORY CONCERNS:
- OFAC Sanctions: Interaction with TornadoCash requires blocking and reporting

- Proceeds of Crime: Cannot rule out illicit source of funds

MANDATORY ACTIONS:
⚠ DO NOT OPEN ACCOUNT - Risk profile UNACCEPTABLE
⚠ HUMAN REVIEW by Head of Compliance MANDATORY before any reconsideration
⚠ File Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with FinCEN and local FIU
⚠ Block any pending transactions involving sanctioned entities (TornadoCash)
