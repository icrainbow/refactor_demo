Registration Date: 2019-03-22
Business Purpose: Investment Holding Company

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ULTIMATE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP (UBO) - CRITICAL GAPS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ALERT: Beneficial ownership information is INCOMPLETE and UNVERIFIABLE

Structure Overview:
- Meridian Capital Holdings Ltd (BVI) ← Client's primary entity
  ↓ Owned by: Cayman Islands Trust ("Meridian Family Trust")
    ↓ Trustees: Professional trustee service (refusing disclosure)
      ↓ Settlor: UNKNOWN - "To be determined upon request"
        ↓ Beneficiaries: 5 unnamed individuals (identities withheld)

UBO Documentation Status:
✗ Beneficial owner identities: REFUSED / NOT PROVIDED
✗ Trust deed: REDACTED version only (beneficiaries removed)
✗ Settlor information: UNKNOWN
✗ Source of trust assets: UNDISCLOSED
✗ Control persons: Professional nominees only (no natural persons identified)

REGULATORY CONCERN: Unable to identify natural persons with >25% ownership or control.
This violates 4th AML Directive requirements for UBO transparency.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OFFSHORE STRUCTURE - HIGH-RISK JURISDICTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Corporate Structure Red Flags:
- BVI incorporation (known for opacity and minimal disclosure requirements)
- Cayman Islands trust layer (zero corporate tax, no public registry)
- Cyprus holding company as intermediate layer (identified in financial leaks)
- Panama shell company as payment processor (no substance, mail forwarding only)
- Layered ownership across 4 offshore jurisdictions with NO operating business

No physical presence identified in ANY jurisdiction.
No employees, no offices, no operational activities beyond fund transfers.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FINANCIAL FLOWS - STRUCTURING & LAYERING CONCERNS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Transaction Pattern Analysis (Last 24 months):

Funds IN:
- Wire transfers from 12 different jurisdictions (Turkey, UAE, Russia, China, Switzerland)
- Payments labeled as "consulting fees" with NO contracts provided
- Invoice descriptions: vague ("professional services", "business advisory")
- Total inflows: $18.7M USD

Funds OUT:
- Distributions to 8 unknown beneficial owner accounts
- Real estate purchases in London, Monaco, Dubai (shell company buyers)
- Layering through multiple intermediary accounts before final destination
- No clear business purpose or legitimate commercial rationale

AML CONCERN: Pattern consistent with LAYERING and STRUCTURING to obscure source/destination.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOURCE OF WEALTH - UNVERIFIABLE CLAIMS

"International business consulting and advisory services"

Documentation Provided:
✗ NO employment contracts
